## Sp√©fications Techniques d'Utilisation du Minitel 1B

I got sick of not being able to search through the docs, so I OCR'ed it. But then, what's the point of having it in a PDF, when it could be actual text?

I spent some time fixing the OCR errors, and the original errors of the specs, while probably adding new ones.

I added the page numbers as anchors (that's the numbers on the right of the page) and all the headers have their own id, to be anchorable.

Did I spend way too long on that page? Probably.
Is anyone ever going to see it? Probably not. But it's there anyway. Hopefully someone will find it as useful as it would have been for me when I needed it...

## what has changed from the original

- Some of the layout, because I couldn't be bothered to spend hours on the CSS
- I replaced the odd-looking hex (0/5, 6/A, etc.) to less odd-looking hex (0x05 0x6A etc.)

### what is left to do

- I'd like the tables to look more like the original ones, it would look prettier. Just some CSS, and that would be done.
- Add all the weird bar characters (SVG? pure CSS? PNG?)
